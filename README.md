# Parrot
Welcom to the official repository for the Parrot programming language!

Parrot is a simple, custom, esoteric programming language created for the sole purpose of
understanding how a high-level language will be compiled into lower level code such as assembly and
machine code. Its syntax is designed to mimic the actions of a parrot, meaning it will have limited features
and capabilities. Consequently, it is not flexible enough to be used in creating real-world software projects. It
is also designed to be unconventional and humorous, where the programmer would feel like they're working
with something "bird-brained".
